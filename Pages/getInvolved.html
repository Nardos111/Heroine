    <p>In many developing countries, women suffer from domestic violence and unequal rights. In most cases, women are
        considered second class citizens compared to their male counterparts. Traditionally, women are still expected to
        submit to their husbands and run the household while men bring food to the table and support the family.
        Although a number of women have already been empowered greatly, many are still silenced and hence, organizations
        have seen the need to address this issue. Behind women who are silenced are organizations who support them and
        have had the initiative to open up grants specifically to aid them. Here are some of the organizations who have
        been empowering women all over the globe. <a

            <p class="mb-1">The Canadian Association for the Advancement of Women and Sport and Physical Activity
                (CAAWS) is seeking for applications for their grants for the Women in Sport Encouragement Program
                (WISE). The main goal of this grant is for Canadian girls to remain active and to realize that physical
                activities are not limited to men. Through sports, women will also develop self-discipline and
                eventually leadership skills which will help them in their respective organizations.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="mb-1">Given the number of women in Uganda who don’t have access to proper training in the
                workforce, many depend on their husbands. This can cause women to be silenced in times of abuse due to
                the income they are unable to have. The Women’s Global Empowerment Fund seeks to train Ugandan women on
                how to run a business. Since then, this organization has produced many successful leaders, those
                currently in political office included.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="mb-1">Abortion has been a long-time debate in many parts of the world. Whether it should be
                permitted or legalized at current is a question which circulates many opposing views. In line with this,
                the Center for Reproductive Rights believes that a woman should be in charge of deciding. So far this
                organization has been successful in participating to improve reproductive health laws in Asia, Africa,
                and the United States. Apart from that, the organization is also involved in trying to abolish the
                abortion ban in El Salvador. The center thinks it is unjust to jail women for deciding for themselves
                and is continually working on abolishing this policy.

            <p class="mb-1">Every Mother Counts is an activist group who sees the need for medical resources for medical
                resources in many developing countries. This organization has been providing international grants for
                NGOsin Tanzania, Haiti, and India. Their aim is to provide training for those in the medical field,
                supply hospitals with the necessary equipment to operate more productively and to improve the means of
                transportation as time can be a crucial part in saving lives. Through their grants, Every Mother Counts
                hopes to decrease the number of women who die in childbirth or those who incur complications.</p>

            <h5 class="mb-1"> National Organization for Women
            </h5>
            <p class="mb-1">The National Organization for Women appreciates that women are now more active in the
                workforce as compared to a decade ago, but still believe that the role of women in the society still has
                a long way to go. Several issues they fight for are the unequal pay for men and women in the workforce,
                discrimination in and out of the workplace, and the body image society states women should have, among
                others.
